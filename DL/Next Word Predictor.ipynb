      "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\n",
      "mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\n",
      "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n",
      "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n",
      "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n",
      "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n",
      "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n",
      "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\n",
      "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\n",
      "drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n",
      "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n",
      "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n",
      "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n",
      "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n",
      "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n",
      "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\n",
      "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n",
      "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
      "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n",
      "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n",
      "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\n",
      "soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\n",
      "books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\n",
      "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
      "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n",
      "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n",
      "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n",
      "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
      "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n",
      "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\n",
      "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n",
      "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n",
      "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n",
      "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
      "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\n",
      "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n",
      "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n",
      "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n",
      "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n",
      "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n",
      "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
      "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n",
      "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n",
      "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n",
      "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n",
      "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
      "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n",
      "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
      "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
      "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
      "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n",
      "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\n",
      "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seven!” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
      "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n",
      "that you intended to go into harness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, how do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
      "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n",
      "servant girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
      "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
      "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
      "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
      "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n",
      "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n",
      "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n",
      "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
      "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n",
      "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n",
      "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n",
      "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
      "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n",
      "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n",
      "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n",
      "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n",
      "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
      "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
      "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n",
      "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n",
      "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
      "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
      "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
      "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
      "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Frequently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How often?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then how many are there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many? I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
      "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
      "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n",
      "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n",
      "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n",
      "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n",
      "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\n",
      "said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\n",
      "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n",
      "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
      "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
      "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
      "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
      "wear a mask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n",
      "means?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
      "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
      "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
      "written.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
      "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n",
      "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
      "stiff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n",
      "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\n",
      "with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n",
      "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n",
      "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
      "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
      "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
      "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\n",
      "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
      "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\n",
      "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n",
      "from his cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
      "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\n",
      "all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\n",
      "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
      "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\n",
      "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\n",
      "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\n",
      "doubts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\n",
      "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
      "whistled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n",
      "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
      "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\n",
      "is nothing else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\n",
      "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But your client—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
      "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\n",
      "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\n",
      "authoritative tap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\n",
      "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\n",
      "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\n",
      "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
      "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\n",
      "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\n",
      "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\n",
      "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\n",
      "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\n",
      "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\n",
      "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
      "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
      "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\n",
      "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
      "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\n",
      "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\n",
      "of obstinacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
      "marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\n",
      "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\n",
      "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\n",
      "have I the honour to address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",
      "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\n",
      "discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\n",
      "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\n",
      "alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\n",
      "my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\n",
      "gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\n",
      "“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\n",
      "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\n",
      "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\n",
      "European history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise,” said Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\n",
      "person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\n",
      "confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\n",
      "not exactly my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\n",
      "be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\n",
      "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\n",
      "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\n",
      "kings of Bohemia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\n",
      "his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\n",
      "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\n",
      "most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\n",
      "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\n",
      "should be better able to advise you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\n",
      "uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\n",
      "the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\n",
      "he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\n",
      "was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\n",
      "Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\n",
      "Bohemia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\n",

      "shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\n",
      "however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\n",

      "surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\n",
      "associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\n",
      "the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\n",
      "character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\n",
      "investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\n",
      "masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\n",
      "made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\n",
      "quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\n",
      "mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\n",
      "possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\n",
      "groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\n",
      "disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\n",
      "friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\n",
      "times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\n",
      "vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\n",
      "tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\n",
      "pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\n",
      "heartily for some minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\n",

      "\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\n",
      "perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\n",
      "I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the\n",
      "character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\n",
      "freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\n",
      "that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\n",
      "villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\n",
      "the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\n",
      "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\n",
      "and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\n",
      "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\n",
      "could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\n",
      "examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\n",
      "anything else of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\n",
      "was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\n",
      "the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\n",
      "exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\n",
      "and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\n",
      "nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\n",
      "not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\n",
      "listen to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\n",
      "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\n",
      "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\n",
      "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\n",
      "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\n",
      "never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\n",
      "Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\n",
      "confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\n",
      "and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\n",
      "began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\n",
      "over my plan of campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\n",
      "He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\n",
      "them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\n",
      "his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\n",
      "transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\n",
      "likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\n",
      "continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\n",
      "gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\n",
      "widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\n",
      "details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\n",
      "to understand the situation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am following you closely,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\n",
      "to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\n",
      "handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom\n",
      "I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\n",
      "to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\n",
      "a man who was thoroughly at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\n",
      "him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\n",
      "excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\n",
      "he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\n",
      "the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\n",
      "earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &\n",
      "Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\n",
      "Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\n",
      "to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\n",
      "with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\n",
      "the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t\n",
      "pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\n",
      "caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\n",
      "a face that a man might die for.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\n",
      "you reach it in twenty minutes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\n",
      "I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\n",
      "cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\n",
      "fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.\n",
      "Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\n",
      "minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\n",
      "clear enough what was in the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others\n",
      "were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\n",
      "were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\n",
      "into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\n",
      "followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\n",
      "them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\n",
      "lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\n",
      "church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\n",
      "me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘What then?’ I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\n",
      "found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\n",
      "vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\n",
      "the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\n",
      "bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\n",
      "thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\n",
      "clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\n",
      "in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\n",
      "that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\n",
      "informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\n",
      "to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\n",
      "appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\n",
      "streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\n",
      "mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\n",
      "pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\n",
      "and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\n",
      "separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I\n",
      "shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left\n",
      "him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\n",
      "went off to make my own arrangements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I\n",

      "He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\n",
      "character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\n",
      "broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\n",
      "smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\n",
      "as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\n",
      "Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\n",
      "seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\n",
      "fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\n",
      "specialist in crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\n",
      "wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\n",
      "Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\n",
      "we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\n",
      "of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\n",
      "less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\n",
      "quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\n",
      "shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\n",
      "scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\n",
      "nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\n",
      "down with cigars in their mouths.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\n",
      "house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\n",
      "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\n",
      "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\n",
      "to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\n",
      "the photograph?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where, indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n",
      "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
      "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\n",
      "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\n",
      "she does not carry it about with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\n",
      "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\n",
      "to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\n",
      "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\n",
      "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\n",
      "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\n",
      "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\n",
      "in her own house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it has twice been burgled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how will you look?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will get her to show me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she will refuse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\n",
      "carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\n",
      "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\n",
      "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\n",
      "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\n",
      "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\n",
      "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\n",
      "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\n",
      "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\n",
      "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\n",
      "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n",
      "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n",
      "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\n",
      "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\n",
      "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\n",
      "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\n",
      "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\n",
      "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\n",
      "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\n",
      "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\n",
      "the hall, looking back into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\n",
      "before you can get him to hospital.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\n",
      "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\n",
      "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\n",
      "This way, please!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\n",
      "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\n",
      "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\n",
      "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\n",
      "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\n",
      "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\n",
      "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\n",
      "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\n",
      "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\n",
      "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\n",
      "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\n",
      "thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\n",
      "injuring another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\n",
      "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\n",
      "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\n",
      "rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\n",
      "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\n",
      "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\n",
      "“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\n",
      "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\n",
      "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\n",
      "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n",
      "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\n",
      "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\n",
      "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\n",
      "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\n",
      "better. It is all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have the photograph?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know where it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did you find out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am still in the dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\n",
      "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\n",
      "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guessed as much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\n",
      "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\n",
      "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That also I could fathom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\n",
      "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\n",
      "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\n",
      "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\n",
      "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did that help you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\n",
      "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\n",
      "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\n",
      "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\n",
      "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\n",
      "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\n",
      "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\n",
      "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\n",
      "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\n",
      "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n",
      "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\n",
      "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\n",
      "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n",
      "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\n",
      "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\n",
      "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\n",
      "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\n",
      "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\n",
      "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\n",
      "into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\n",
      "when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\n",
      "a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when will you call?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\n",
      "clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\n",
      "complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\n",
      "delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\n",
      "searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\n",
      "appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\n",
      "street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\n",
      "and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\n",
      "shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you have hopes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must have a cab.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my brougham is waiting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once\n",
      "more for Briony Lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Married! When?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But to whom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she could not love him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in hopes that she does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why in hopes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\n",
      "the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\n",
      "not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\n",
      "your Majesty’s plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\n",
      "What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\n",
      "which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\n",
      "steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\n",
      "brougham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\n",
      "questioning and rather startled gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\n",
      "this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\n",
      "the Continent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\n",
      "surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never to return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\n",
      "drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\n",
      "scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\n",
      "drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\n",
      "Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\n",
      "plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\n",
      "photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\n",
      "superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\n",
      "friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\n",
      "midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\n",
      "    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\n",
      "    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\n",
      "    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\n",
      "    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\n",
      "    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\n",
      "    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\n",
      "    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\n",
      "    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\n",
      "    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\n",
      "    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\n",
      "    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\n",
      "    down just as you departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\n",
      "    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\n",
      "    the Temple to see my husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\n",
      "    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\n",
      "    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\n",
      "    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\n",
      "    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\n",
      "    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\n",
      "    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\n",
      "    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\n",
      "    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n",

      "“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\n",
      "all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\n",
      "she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\n",
      "that she was not on my level?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\n",
      "different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that\n",
      "I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\n",
      "successful conclusion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\n",
      "successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\n",
      "safe as if it were in the fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\n",
      "you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\n",
      "held it out upon the palm of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\n",
      "said Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have but to name it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This photograph!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\n",
      "I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and,\n",
      "turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\n",
      "out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\n",

but he was glad, I think,\\nto see me', ' With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner', ' Then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion', '\\n\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked', ' “I think, Watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you', '”\\n\\n“Seven!” I answered', '\\n\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more', ' Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson', ' And in practice again, I observe', ' You did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness', '”\\n\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\n\\n“I see it, I deduce it', ' How do I know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?”\\n\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much', ' You would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago', ' It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it', ' As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out', '”\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together', '\\n\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts', ' Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it', ' Hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey', ' As\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession', '”\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction', ' “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process', ' And yet I\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours', '”\\n\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair', ' “You see, but you do not observe', ' The\\ndistinction is clear', ' For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room', '”\\n\\n“Frequently', '”\\n\\n“How often?”\\n\\n“Well, some hundreds of times', '”\\n\\n“Then how many are there?”\\n\\n“How many? I don’t know', '”\\n\\n“Quite so! You have not observed', ' And yet you have seen', ' That is just\\nmy point', ' Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\nboth seen and observed', ' By the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this', '” He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table', ' “It came by the last post,” said he', ' “Read it aloud', '”\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address', '\\n\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment', ' Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated', '\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received', ' Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask', '”\\n\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked', ' “What do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n\\n“I have no data yet', ' It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata', ' Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts', ' But the note itself', ' What do you deduce from\\nit?”\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten', '\\n\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes', ' “Such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet', ' It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff', '”\\n\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes', ' “It is not an English\\npaper at all', ' Hold it up to the light', '”\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\\nwith a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper', '\\n\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes', '\\n\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather', '”\\n\\n“Not at all', ' The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\\nwhich is the German for ‘Company', '’ It is a customary contraction like\\nour ‘Co', '’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier', '’ Now for the ‘Eg', '’ Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer', '” He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves', ' “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria', ' It is in a\\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad', ' ‘Remarkable\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills', '’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\nfrom his cigarette', '\\n\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said', '\\n\\n“Precisely', ' And the man who wrote the note is a German', ' Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\\nall quarters received', '’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\\nthat', ' It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs', ' It only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\\nface', ' And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\ndoubts', '”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell', ' Holmes\\nwhistled', '\\n\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he', ' “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\\nthe window', ' “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties', ' A hundred\\nand fifty guineas apiece', ' There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\\nis nothing else', '”\\n\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes', '”\\n\\n“Not a bit, Doctor', ' Stay where you are', ' I am lost without my Boswell', '\\nAnd this promises to be interesting', ' It would be a pity to miss it', '”\\n\\n“But your client—”\\n\\n“Never mind him', ' I may want your help, and so may he', ' Here he comes', '\\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention', '”\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door', ' Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap', '\\n\\n“Come in!” said Holmes', '\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules', ' His dress was rich\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\ntaste', ' Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\nberyl', ' Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance', ' He\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\nwas still raised to it as he entered', ' From the lower part of the face\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\\nof obstinacy', '\\n\\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent', ' “I told you that I would call', '” He looked from\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address', '\\n\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes', ' “This is my friend and colleague, Dr', '\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases', ' Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?”\\n\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman', ' I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance', ' If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\\nalone', '”\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair', ' “It is both, or none,” said he', ' “You may say before this\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me', '”\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders', ' “Then I must begin,” said he,\\n“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance', ' At present it is not too\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\nEuropean history', '”\\n\\n“I promise,” said Holmes', '\\n\\n“And I', '”\\n\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor', ' “The august\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own', '”\\n\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly', '\\n\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe', ' To speak\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\nkings of Bohemia', '”\\n\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\nhis armchair and closing his eyes', '\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe', ' Holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client', '\\n\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\nshould be better able to advise you', '”\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation', ' Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground', ' “You are right,”\\nhe cried; “I am the King', ' Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes', ' “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\nBohemia', '”\\n\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\nperson', ' Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\nan agent without putting myself in his power', ' I have come _incognito_\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you', '”\\n\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more', '\\n\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\\nIrene Adler', ' The name is no doubt familiar to you', '”\\n\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes', ' For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\ninformation', ' In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes', '\\n\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes', ' “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858', '\\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!\\nRetired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\\nthose letters back', '”\\n\\n“Precisely so', ' But how—”\\n\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\n\\n“None', '”\\n\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\n\\n“None', '”\\n\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty', ' If this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n\\n“There is the writing', '”\\n\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery', '”\\n\\n“My private note-paper', '”\\n\\n“Stolen', '”\\n\\n“My own seal', '”\\n\\n“Imitated', '”\\n\\n“My photograph', '”\\n\\n“Bought', '”\\n\\n“We were both in the photograph', '”\\n\\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion', '”\\n\\n“I was mad—insane', '”\\n\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously', '”\\n\\n“I was only Crown Prince then', ' I was young', ' I am but thirty now', '”\\n\\n“It must be recovered', '”\\n\\n“We have tried and failed', '”\\n\\n“Your Majesty must pay', ' It must be bought', '”\\n\\n“She will not sell', '”\\n\\n“Stolen, then', '”\\n\\n“Five attempts have been made', ' Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse', ' Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled', ' Twice she has\\nbeen waylaid', ' There has been no result', '”\\n\\n“No sign of it?”\\n\\n“Absolutely none', '”\\n\\nHolmes laughed', ' “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he', '\\n\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully', '\\n\\n“Very, indeed', ' And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n\\n“To ruin me', '”\\n\\n“But how?”\\n\\n“I am about to be married', '”\\n\\n“So I have heard', '”\\n\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia', ' You may know the strict principles of her family', ' She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy', ' A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end', '”\\n\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\n\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph', ' And she will do it', ' I know that\\nshe will do it', ' You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel', ' She\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men', ' Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\\nlengths to which she would not go—none', '”\\n\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n\\n“I am sure', '”\\n\\n“And why?”\\n\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed', ' That will be next Monday', '”\\n\\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn', ' “That is\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\njust at present', ' Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\npresent?”\\n\\n“Certainly', ' You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm', '”\\n\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress', '”\\n\\n“Pray do so', ' I shall be all anxiety', '”\\n\\n“Then, as to money?”\\n\\n“You have _carte blanche_', '”\\n\\n“Absolutely?”\\n\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\nhave that photograph', '”\\n\\n“And for present expenses?”\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\nit on the table', '\\n\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid', '\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\nto him', '\\n\\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked', '\\n\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St', ' John’s Wood', '”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it', ' “One other question,” said he', ' “Was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n\\n“It was', '”\\n\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\nsome good news for you', ' And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street', ' “If you will be\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like\\nto chat this little matter over with you', '”\\n\\n\\nII', '\\n\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\nyet returned', ' The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\nshortly after eight o’clock in the morning', ' I sat down beside the fire,\\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be', '\\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\\ncharacter of its own', ' Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\nmysteries', ' So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head', '\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room', ' Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he', ' With a nod he\\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old', ' Putting his hands into his\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes', '\\n\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair', '\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“It’s quite too funny', ' I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing', '”\\n\\n“I can’t imagine', ' I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler', '”\\n\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual', ' I will tell you, however', '\\nI left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the\\ncharacter of a groom out of work', ' There is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men', ' Be one of them, and you will know all\\nthat there is to know', ' I soon found Briony Lodge', ' It is a _bijou_\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories', ' Chubb lock to the door', ' Large sitting-room on\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\nopen', ' Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house', ' I walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest', '\\n\\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden', ' I lent\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\nlisten to', '”\\n\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked', '\\n\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part', ' She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet', ' So say the\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man', ' She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner', ' Seldom\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings', ' Has only one male\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him', ' He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice', ' He is a Mr', ' Godfrey\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple', ' See the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant', ' They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\nand knew all about him', ' When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\\nover my plan of campaign', '\\n\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter', '\\nHe was a lawyer', ' That sounded ominous', ' What was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\\nhis friend, or his mistress?

eyes upon my companion', '\\n\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr', ' Holmes?”\\nhe asked', ' “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour', '\\nIt’s as true as

left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\nrest it upon the desk?”\\n\\n“Well, but China?”\\n\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\ncould only have been done in China', ' I have made a small study of tattoo\\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject', ' That\\ntrick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite\\npeculiar to China', ' When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple', '”\\n\\nMr', ' Jabez Wilson laughed heavily', ' “Well, I never!” said he', ' “I thought\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\nnothing in it after all', '”\\n\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a

had\\nupon your fortunes', ' You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\\nand the date', '”\\n\\n“It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890', ' Just two months ago', '”\\n\\n“Very good', ' Now, Mr', ' Wilson?”\\n\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr', ' Sherlock Holmes,”\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the City', ' It’s not a very large affair,\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living', ' I\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\\nwages so as to learn the business', '”\\n\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes', '\\n\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either', ' It’s\\nhard to say his age', ' I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr', ' Holmes;\\nand I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I\\nam able to give him', ' But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\nput ideas in his head?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed?

Have you a family?’\\n\\n“I answered that I had not', '\\n\\n“His face fell immediately', '\\n\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\nto hear you say that', ' The fund was, of course, for the propagation and\\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance', ' It is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor', '’\\n\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr', ' Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\\nminutes he said that it would be all right', '\\n\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but\\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\\nyours', ' When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I', '\\n\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr', ' Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding', ' ‘I\\nshould be

enough to\\ngain', '’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune', '\\n\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\\ncould not

Vincent\\nSpaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had\\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing', ' However, in the morning I\\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\nstarted off for Pope’s Court', '\\n\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible', '\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr', ' Duncan Ross was there to\\nsee that I got fairly to work', ' He started me off upon the letter A, and\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from

'\\n\\n“This went on day after day, Mr', ' Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work', ' It\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after', ' Every morning I\\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two', ' By degrees Mr', '\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\\ntime, he did not come in at all', ' Still, of course, I never dared to\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I

might get on to the B’s before very long', ' It cost me\\nsomething in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\\nwritings', ' And then suddenly the whole business came to an end', '”\\n\\n“To an end?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir', ' And no later than this morning', ' I went to my work as usual\\nat ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack', ' Here\\nit is, and you can read for yourself', '”\\n\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\\nnote-paper', ' It read in this fashion:\\n\\n“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED', ' October 9, 1890', '”\\n\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\nof laughter', '\\n\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head', ' “If you can do nothing\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere', '”\\n\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\nhad half risen', ' “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world', ' It is\\nmost refreshingly unusual', ' But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\nso, something just a little funny about it', ' Pray what steps did you\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?”\\n\\n“I was staggered, sir', ' I did not know what to do', ' Then I called at the\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it', '\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\nground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\nthe Red-headed League', ' He said that he had never heard of any such\\nbody', ' Then I asked him who Mr', ' Duncan Ross was', ' He answered that the\\nname was new to him', '\\n\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No', ' 4', '’\\n\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\n\\n“‘Yes', '’\\n\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris', ' He was a solicitor and\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new

left him', '”\\n\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\n\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir', ' There’s never very much to do of a\\nmorning', '”\\n\\n“That will do, Mr', ' Wilson',

“the more bizarre a thing is the less\\nmysterious it proves to be', ' It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\ndifficult to

Doctor—as no\\ndoubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\\nprincipal London banks', ' Mr', ' Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\\nand he will explain to you that

The husband was a\\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\\nout his false teeth and hurling

an investigation', ' The larger crimes are\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\\nrule, is the motive', ' In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter

over, for this\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken', '”\\n\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street', ' Looking over\\nhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\\nof Devonshire fashion over her ear', ' From under this great panoply she\\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\\nglove buttons', ' Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\nthe bell', '\\n\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\\ncigarette into the fire', ' “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\n_affaire de cœur_', ' She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication', ' And yet even here we may\\ndiscriminate', ' When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire', ' Here we\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved', ' But here she comes in person to\\nresolve our doubts', '”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\npilot boat', ' Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\\nfashion which was peculiar to him', '\\n\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little\\ntrying to do so much typewriting?”\\n\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are\\nwithout looking', '” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face', ' “You’ve heard about\\nme, Mr', ' Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things', '\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook', ' If not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs', ' Etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\\nfor dead', ' Oh, Mr', ' Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me', ' I’m not\\nrich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\\nlittle that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\\nhas become of Mr', ' Hosmer Angel', '”\\n\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling', '\\n\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\nSutherland', ' “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made\\nme angry to see the easy way in which Mr', ' Windibank—that is, my\\nfather—took it all', ' He would not go to the police, and he would not go\\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\\nand came right away to you', '”\\n\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent', '”\\n\\n“Yes, my stepfather', ' I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself', '”\\n\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well', ' I wasn’t best pleased, Mr', ' Holmes,\\nwhen she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself', ' Father was a plumber in the\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\nmother carried on with Mr', ' Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr', ' Windibank\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\ntraveller in wines', ' They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\\nwhich wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been\\nalive', '”\\n\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\nthe greatest concentration of attention', '\\n\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir', ' It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\\nAuckland', ' It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent', ' Two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest', '”\\n\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes', ' “And since you draw so large\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way', ' I believe that\\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60', '”\\n\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr', ' Holmes, but you understand\\nthat as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them', ' Of\\ncourse, that is only just for the time', ' Mr', ' Windibank draws my interest\\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\npretty well with what I earn at typewriting', ' It brings me twopence a\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day', '”\\n\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes', ' “This is\\nmy friend, Dr', ' Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\nmyself', ' Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr', ' Hosmer\\nAngel', '”\\n\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\nthe fringe of her jacket', ' “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”\\nshe said', ' “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother', ' Mr', ' Windibank\\ndid not wish us to go', ' He never did wish us to go anywhere', ' He would\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat', ' But\\nthis time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\\nprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\nfather’s friends were to be there', ' And he said that I had nothing fit\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\nout of the drawer', ' At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\\nFrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\\nMr', ' Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr', '\\nHosmer Angel', '”\\n\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr', ' Windibank came back from\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball', '”\\n\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it', ' He laughed, I remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way', '”\\n\\n“I see', ' Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a\\ngentleman called Mr', ' Hosmer Angel', '”\\n\\n“Yes, sir', ' I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr', '\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\nagain, and Mr', ' Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more', '”\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort', ' He wouldn’t\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\nshould be happy in her own family circle', ' But then, as I used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\nmine yet', '”\\n\\n“But how about Mr', ' Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\nhe had gone', ' We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\\nday', ' I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\\nfather to know', '”\\n\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Mr', ' Holmes', ' We were engaged after the first walk that we\\ntook', ' Hosmer—Mr', ' Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\nStreet—and—”\\n\\n“What office?”\\n\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr', ' Holmes, I don’t know', '”\\n\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\n\\n“He slept on the premises', '”\\n\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\n\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street', '”\\n\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\n\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for', ' He\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said\\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us', ' That\\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, Mr', ' Holmes, and the little\\nthings that he would think of', '”\\n\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes', ' “It has long been an axiom of\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important', ' Can you\\nremember any other little things about Mr', ' Hosmer Angel?”\\n\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr', ' Holmes', ' He would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\nconspicuous', ' Very retiring and gentlemanly he was', ' Even his voice was\\ngentle', ' He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\nwhispering fashion of speech', ' He was always well dressed, very neat and\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\nglasses against the glare', '”\\n\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr', ' Windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto France?”\\n\\n“Mr', ' Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back', ' He was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\\nalways be true to him', ' Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion', ' Mother was all in his favour\\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than I was', ' Then, when they\\ntalked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him', ' I\\ndidn’t quite like that, Mr', ' Holmes', ' It seemed funny that I should ask\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\nvery morning of the wedding', '”\\n\\n“It missed him, then?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived', '”\\n\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate', ' Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\nFriday', ' Was it to be in church?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly', ' It was to be at St', ' Saviour’s, near King’s\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St', ' Pancras\\nHotel', ' Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street', ' We got to the church\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\nlooked there was no one there!

Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\\nmine', ' And yet, what could have happened?

across your shoulders', ' By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not\\npart of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and

the window we\\ncould see Mr', ' James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\nroad', '\\n\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more', ' “That fellow will rise from\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows', '\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest', '”\\n\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I\\nremarked', '\\n\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr', ' Hosmer\\nAngel must have some strong object

together, but that the one always appeared when the other\\nwas away, was suggestive', ' So were the tinted spectacles and the curious\\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers', ' My\\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\\nit', ' You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\nall pointed in the same direction', '”\\n\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\n\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration', ' I knew\\nthe firm for which this man worked', ' Having taken the printed\\ndescription', ' I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\nof a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to\\nthe firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered\\nto the description of any of their travellers', ' I had already noticed\\nthe peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at\\nhis business address asking him if he would come here', ' As I expected,\\nhis reply was typewritten

into a gigantic ball and\\ntossed them up onto the rack', '\\n\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked', '\\n\\n“Not a word', ' I have not seen a paper for some days', '”\\n\\n“The London press has not had very full accounts', ' I have just been\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars', ' It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those

as far as I have been able to\\nunderstand it, in a very few words', '\\n\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\nHerefordshire', ' The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr', ' John\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country', ' One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\nlet to Mr', ' Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian', ' The men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\npossible', ' Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\\nthey were frequently together', ' McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\\nand Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\\nhad wives living', ' They appear to have avoided the society of the\\nneighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\\nrace-meetings of the neighbourhood', ' McCarthy kept two servants—a man\\nand a girl', ' Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\\nleast', ' That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\nfamilies', ' Now for the facts', '\\n\\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream\\nwhich runs down the Boscombe Valley', ' He had been out with his\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three', '\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive', '\\n\\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground', ' One was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr', ' Turner', ' Both these witnesses depose\\nthat Mr', ' McCarthy was walking alone', ' The game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing Mr', ' McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr', '\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm', ' To the\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\nthe son was following him', ' He thought no more of the matter until he\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred', '\\n\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them', ' The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge', ' A girl\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers', '\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\nand close by the lake, Mr', ' McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\nto be having a violent quarrel', ' She heard Mr', ' McCarthy the elder using\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\\nhand as if to strike his father', ' She was so frightened by their\\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight', ' She had hardly said\\nthe words when young Mr', ' McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\nof the lodge-keeper', ' He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\nfresh blood', ' On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\nupon the grass beside the pool', ' The head had been beaten in by repeated\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon', ' The injuries were such as might\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body', ' Under\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\nof ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\\nwas on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next Assizes', ' Those are the main facts of the\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and the police-court', '”\\n\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked', ' “If ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here', '”\\n\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\\nthoughtfully', ' “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\\nan equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different', ' It\\nmust be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\nculprit', ' There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\\nbelieve in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may\\nrecollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case\\nin his interest', ' Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\\nto me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\nbreakfasts at home', '”\\n\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case', '”\\n\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing', ' “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr', ' Lestrade', ' You know me\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\nemploying, or even of understanding', ' To take the first example to hand,\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr', ' Lestrade would have\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that', '”\\n\\n“How on earth—”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well', ' I know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you', ' You shave every morning, and in this season you\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\nas we get farther back on

of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\\nsatisfied with such a result', ' I only quote this as a trivial example of\\nobservation and inference', ' Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just\\npossible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\\nbefore us', ' There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering', '”\\n\\n“What are they?”\\n\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm', ' On the inspector of constabulary informing\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts', ' This observation of\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury', '”\\n\\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated', '\\n\\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence', '”\\n\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\na most suspicious remark', '”\\n\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can\\nat present see in the clouds', ' However innocent he might be, he could\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\nwere very black against him', ' Had he appeared surprised at his own\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\\na scheming man', ' His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\nand firmness', ' As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\nhis hand as if to strike him', ' The self-reproach and contrition which\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\nmind rather than of a guilty one', '”\\n\\nI shook my head', ' “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”\\nI remarked', '\\n\\n“So they have', ' And many men have been wrongfully hanged', '”\\n\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive', ' You will find\\nit here, and may read it for yourself', '”\\n\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\noccurred', ' I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read\\nit very carefully', ' It ran in this way:\\n\\n“Mr', ' James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\nthe 3rd', ' My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\nCobb, the groom', ' Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\nwas going', ' I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\\nBoscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\\nis upon the other side', ' On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\nthinking that I was following my father', ' I had no idea that he was in\\nfront of me', ' When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\\n“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself', ' I then\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool', ' He appeared to be\\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\\ndoing there', ' A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper', ' Seeing that\\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\\nHatherley Farm', ' I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again', ' I\\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\ninjured', ' I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired', ' I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\\nmy way to Mr', ' Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\\nask for assistance', ' I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries', ' He was not a popular man,\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\\nas I know, no active enemies', ' I know nothing further of the matter', '’\\n\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could

It is the more strange, since we\\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea', ' The daughter told us\\nas much', ' Do you not deduce something from that?”\\n\\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,\\nwinking at me', ' “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\nflying away after theories and fancies', '”\\n\\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to\\ntackle the facts', '”\\n\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\nget hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth', '\\n\\n“And that is—”\\n\\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine', '”\\n\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing', '\\n“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\\nleft', '”\\n\\n“Yes, that is it', '” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\\ntwo-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\nthe grey walls', ' The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\\nheavy upon it', ' We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\ndeath, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had\\nthen had', ' Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool', '\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis', ' Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\\nStreet would have failed to recognise him', ' His face flushed and\\ndarkened', ' His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter', ' His face was\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\nstood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck', ' His nostrils seemed\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\\nquick, impatient snarl in reply', ' Swiftly and silently he made his way\\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool', ' It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\\ndistrict, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\\namid the short grass which bounded it on either side', ' Sometimes Holmes\\nwould hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\\ndetour into the meadow', ' Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\\nindifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\\nwas directed towards a definite end', '\\n\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr', ' Turner', ' Above the woods\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling', ' On\\nthe Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake', ' Lestrade showed us the\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\nthe fall of the stricken man', ' To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\ntrampled grass', ' He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\nthen turned upon my companion', '\\n\\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked', '\\n\\n“I fished about with a rake', ' I thought there might be some weapon or\\nother trace', ' But how on earth—”\\n\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\ntwist is all over the place', ' A mole could trace it, and there it\\nvanishes among the reeds', ' Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\\nit', ' Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\\ncovered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body', ' But here are\\nthree separate tracks of the same feet', '” He drew out a lens and lay\\ndown upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\\nrather to himself than to us', ' “These are young McCarthy’s feet', ' Twice\\nhe was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\\nmarked and the heels hardly visible', ' That bears out his story', ' He ran\\nwhen he saw his father on the ground', ' Then here are the father’s feet\\nas he paced up and down', ' What is this, then?

within the edge of the wood and under the\\nshadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood', ' Holmes\\ntraced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction', ' For a long time he remained\\nthere, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\\nseemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\\nnot only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\\nreach', ' A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\\ncarefully examined and retained', ' Then he followed a pathway through the\\nwood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost', '\\n\\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning\\nto his natural manner',

none', '”\\n\\n“How do you know, then?”\\n\\n“The grass was growing under it', ' It had only lain there a few days', '\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken', ' It corresponds\\nwith the injuries', ' There is no sign of any other weapon', '”\\n\\n“And the murderer?”\\n\\n“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak,

laughed', ' “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said', '\\n“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\nBritish jury', '”\\n\\n“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes calmly', ' “You work your own method,\\nand I shall work mine', ' I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\nprobably return to London by the evening train', '”\\n\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\n\\n“No, finished', '”\\n\\n“But the mystery?”\\n\\n“It is solved', '”\\n\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\n\\n“The gentleman I describe', '”\\n\\n“But who is he?”\\n\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out', ' This is not such a\\npopulous neighbourhood', '”\\n\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders', ' “I am a practical man,” he said, “and\\nI really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg', ' I should become the\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard', '”\\n\\n“All right,” said Holmes quietly', ' “I have given you the chance', ' Here\\nare your lodgings', ' Good-bye', ' I shall drop you a line before I leave', '”\\n\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\nfound lunch upon the table',

“just sit down\\nin this chair and let me preach to you for a little', ' I don’t know quite\\nwhat to do, and I should value your advice', ' Light a cigar and let me\\nexpound', '”\\n\\n “Pray do so', '”\\n\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him', ' One was the fact that\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing\\nhim', ' The other was his singular dying reference to a rat', ' He mumbled\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s\\near', ' Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true', '”\\n\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\n\\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son', ' The son, as\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol', ' It was mere chance that he was within\\nearshot', ' The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it\\nwas that he had the appointment with', ' But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians', ' There is a\\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\\nat Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia', '”\\n\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\nout on the table', ' “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said', '\\n“I wired to Bristol for it last night', '” He put his hand over part of\\nthe map', ' “What do you read?”\\n\\n“ARAT,” I read', '\\n\\n“And now?” He raised his hand', '\\n\\n“BALLARAT', '”\\n\\n“Quite so', ' That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables', ' He was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer', ' So and so, of Ballarat', '”\\n\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed', '\\n\\n“It is obvious', ' And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably', ' The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty', ' We have\\ncome now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\nAustralian from Ballarat with a grey cloak', '”\\n\\n“Certainly', '”\\n\\n“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander', '”\\n\\n“Quite so', '”\\n\\n“Then comes our expedition of to-day', ' By an examination of the ground I\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\\nto the personality of the criminal', '”\\n\\n“But how did you gain them?”\\n\\n“You know my method', ' It is founded upon the observation of trifles', '”\\n\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride', ' His boots, too, might be told from their traces', '”\\n\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots', '”\\n\\n“But his lameness?”\\n\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\nleft', ' He put less weight upon it', ' Why?

the\\nshelf beside you', ' Thank you', ' Now let us consider the situation and see\\nwhat may be deduced from it', ' In the first place, we may start with a\\nstrong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason\\nfor leaving America', ' Men at his time of life do not change all their\\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\\nlonely life of an English provincial town', ' His extreme love of solitude\\nin England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\\nsomeone or something which drove him from America', ' As to what it was he\\nfeared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\\nwhich were received by himself and his successors', ' Did you remark the\\npostmarks of those letters?”\\n\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\nfrom London', '”\\n\\n“From East London', ' What do you deduce from that?”\\n\\n“They are all seaports', ' That the writer was on board of a ship', '”\\n\\n“Excellent', ' We have already a clue', ' There can be no doubt that the\\nprobability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a\\nship', ' And now let us consider another point', ' In the case of\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days', ' Does that suggest\\nanything?”\\n\\n“A greater distance to travel', '”\\n\\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come', '”\\n\\n“Then I do not see the point', '”\\n\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or\\nmen are is a sailing-ship', ' It looks as if they always send their\\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission', '\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\\nDundee', ' If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have\\narrived almost as soon as their letter', ' But, as a matter of fact, seven\\nweeks elapsed', ' I think that those seven weeks represented the\\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the\\nsailing vessel which brought the writer', '”\\n\\n“It is possible', '”\\n\\n“More than that', ' It is probable', ' And now you see the deadly urgency of\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution', ' The blow has\\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\\ntravel the distance', ' But this one comes from London, and therefore we\\ncannot count upon delay', '”\\n\\n“Good God!” I cried', ' “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\\n\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship', ' I think that it is quite\\nclear that there must be more than one of them', ' A single man could not\\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s\\njury', ' There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\\nof resource and determination', ' Their papers they mean to have, be the\\nholder of them who it may', ' In this way you see K', ' K', ' K', ' ceases to be\\nthe initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society', '”\\n\\n“But of what society?”\\n\\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his\\nvoice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\n\\n“I never have', '”\\n\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee', ' “Here it is,”\\nsaid he presently:\\n\\n“‘Ku Klux Klan', ' A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\\nsound produced by cocking a rifle', ' This terrible secret society was\\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the\\nCivil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of\\nthe country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,\\nand Florida', ' Its power was used for political purposes, principally for\\nthe terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from\\nthe country of those who were opposed to its views', ' Its outrages were\\nusually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\\nbut generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,\\nmelon seeds or orange pips in others', ' On receiving this the victim\\nmight either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the\\ncountry', ' If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner', ' So perfect was\\nthe organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that\\nthere is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving\\nit with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to\\nthe perpetrators', ' For some years the organisation flourished in spite\\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\\nclasses of the community in the South', ' Eventually, in the year 1869,\\nthe movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been\\nsporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date', '’\\n\\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the\\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\\nof Openshaw from America with their papers', ' It may well have been cause\\nand effect', ' It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\\nmore implacable spirits upon their track', ' You can understand that this\\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\\nrecovered', '”\\n\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\n\\n“Is such as we might expect', ' It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the\\npips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them', ' Then\\nthere are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,\\nand finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C', '\\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,\\nand I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime\\nis to do what I have told him', ' There is nothing more to be said or to\\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget\\nfor half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\\nways of our fellow men', '”\\n\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city', '\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down', '\\n\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\nOpenshaw’s', '”\\n\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked', '\\n\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries', ' I may\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all', '”\\n\\n“You will not go there first?”\\n\\n“No, I shall commence with the City', ' Just ring the bell and the maid\\nwill bring up your coffee', '”\\n\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\\nmy eye over it', ' It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my\\nheart', '\\n\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late', '”\\n\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much', ' How was it\\ndone?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved', '\\n\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near\\nWaterloo Bridge', '’ Here is the account:\\n\\n“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a\\nsplash in the water', ' The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,\\nso that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite\\nimpossible to effect a rescue', ' The alarm, however, was given, and, by\\nthe aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered', ' It\\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from\\nan envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose\\nresidence is near Horsham', ' It is conjectured that he may have been\\nhurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked\\nover the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats', '\\nThe body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt\\nthat the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which\\nshould have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to\\nthe condition of the riverside landing-stages', '’”\\n\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\nthan I had ever seen him', '\\n\\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last', ' “It is a petty feeling,\\nno doubt, but it hurts my pride', ' It becomes a personal matter with me\\nnow, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang', '\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to\\nhis death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a\\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands', '\\n\\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last', ' “How could they\\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\\nto the station', ' The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\nnight, for their purpose', ' Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\\nthe long run', ' I am going out now!”\\n\\n“To the police?”\\n\\n“No;

will know that the office\\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\nLane, where you found me to-night', ' Mrs', ' St', ' Clair had her lunch,\\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking\\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station', ' Have you followed\\nme so far?”\\n\\n“It is very clear', '”\\n\\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs', ' St', ' Clair\\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did\\nnot like the neighbourhood in which she found herself', ' While she was\\nwalking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\\nat her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\\nwindow', ' The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\\ndescribes as being terribly agitated', ' He waved his hands frantically to\\nher, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\\nher that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\nbehind', ' One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\\nhad on neither collar nor necktie', '\\n\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\nsteps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\\nfound me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to\\nascend the stairs which led to the first floor', ' At the foot of the\\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\\nwho thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\\npushed her out into the street', ' Filled with the most maddening doubts\\nand fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\\nFresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\\nway to their beat', ' The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\\nway to the room in which Mr', ' St', ' Clair had last been seen', ' There was no\\nsign of him there', ' In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\\nto be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\\nmade his home there', ' Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon', ' So determined was\\ntheir denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\\nbelieve that Mrs', ' St', ' Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\\nfrom it', ' Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks', ' It was the toy\\nwhich he had promised to bring home', '\\n\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\\nmade the inspector realise that the matter was serious', ' The rooms were\\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime', ' The\\nfront room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\\nbedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves', ' Between\\nthe wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\\ntide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\\nwater', ' The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below', ' On\\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\\nseveral scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\\nbedroom', ' Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\\nclothes of Mr', ' Neville St', ' Clair, with the exception of his coat', ' His\\nboots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there', ' There were no\\nsigns of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\\ntraces of Mr', ' Neville St', ' Clair', ' Out of the window he must apparently\\nhave gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\\nbloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment\\nof the tragedy', '\\n\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\nthe matter', ' The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\\nbut as, by Mrs', ' St', ' Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the\\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance\\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\\ncrime', ' His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\ngentleman’s clothes', '\\n\\n“So much for the Lascar manager', ' Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last\\nhuman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St', ' Clair', ' His name is Hugh\\nBoone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who\\ngoes much to the City', ' He is a professional beggar, though in order to\\navoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\\nvestas', ' Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the\\nleft-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in\\nthe wall', ' Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\\npiteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him', ' I have watched the\\nfellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional\\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\\nreaped in a short time', ' His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\\nno one can pass him without observing him', ' A shock of orange hair, a\\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair\\nof very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\\nto any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by', '\\nThis is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium\\nden, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are\\nin quest', '”\\n\\n“But a cripple!” said I', ' “What could he have done single-handed against\\na man in the prime of life?”\\n\\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man', ' Surely your\\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others', '”\\n\\n“Pray continue your narrative', '”\\n\\n“Mrs', ' St', ' Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could\\nbe of no help to them in their investigations', ' Inspector Barton, who\\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\\nmatter', ' One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\\nincriminate him', ' There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\\nsource', ' He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr', ' Neville St', ' Clair\\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\\nmystery to him as to the police', ' As to Mrs', ' St', ' Clair’s assertion that\\nshe had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\\nmust have been either mad or dreaming', ' He was removed, loudly\\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\nclue', '\\n\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\nfeared to find', ' It was Neville St', ' Clair’s coat, and not Neville St', '\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded', ' And what do you think\\nthey found in the pockets?”\\n\\n“I cannot imagine', '”\\n\\n“No, I don’t think you would guess', ' Every pocket stuffed with pennies\\nand half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies', ' It was no wonder\\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide', ' But a human body is a\\ndifferent matter', ' There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\\nhouse', ' It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river', '”\\n\\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room', '\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\n\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough', ' Suppose that\\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St', ' Clair through the window, there\\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed', ' What would he do then?\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\\ntell-tale garments', ' He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\\nsink', ' He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street', '\\nThere is not an instant to be lost', ' He rushes to some secret hoard,\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\\nof the coat’s sinking', ' He throws it out, and would have done the same\\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared', '”\\n\\n“It certainly sounds feasible', '”\\n\\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better', '\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\\nhim', ' He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one', ' There the matter\\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what\\nNeville St', ' Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when\\nthere, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\\ndisappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever', ' I confess that I\\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties', '”\\n\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of

youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\\nreporter on an evening paper in London', ' One day my editor wished to\\nhave a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\\nvolunteered to supply them', ' There was the point from which all my\\nadventures started', ' It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\\ncould get the facts upon which to base my articles', ' When an actor I\\nhad, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\\nfamous in the green-room for my skill', ' I took advantage now of my\\nattainments', ' I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\\nthe aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster', ' Then with a red head\\nof hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar', '\\nFor seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in

holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\\nCity under my disguise', ' In ten days I had the money and had paid the\\ndebt', '\\n\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\\nat £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\nsitting still', ' It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\\nthe dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\\nin the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\\nface and filling my pockets with coppers', ' Only one man knew my secret', '\\nHe was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\\nLane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\\nevenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town', ' This\\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\\nthat my secret was safe in his possession', '\\n\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money', '\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700\\na year—which is less than my average

her voice\\ndownstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend', ' Swiftly I threw off\\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\\nwig', ' Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise', ' But\\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\\nthat the clothes might betray me', ' I threw open the window, reopening by\\nmy violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\\nbedroom that morning', ' Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\\ncoppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\\nwhich I carried my takings', ' I hurled it out of the window, and it\\ndisappeared into the Thames', ' The other clothes would have followed, but\\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair,

there is anything else for me to explain', ' I was\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\npreference for a dirty face', ' Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear',

whistles at night, the presence of a\\nband of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\\ninterest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion\\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\\nthat secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\\nthose lines', '”\\n\\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\\n\\n“I cannot imagine', '”\\n\\n“I see many objections to any such theory', '”\\n\\n“And so do I', ' It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\\nStoke Moran this day', ' I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\\nor if they may be explained away', ' But what in the name of the devil!”\\n\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\nhimself in the aperture', ' His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\\nhis hand', ' So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\\nthe doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\\nside', ' A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\\nof prey', '\\n\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition', '\\n\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\\nquietly', '\\n\\n“I am Dr', ' Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran', '”\\n\\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly', ' “Pray take a seat', '”\\n\\n“I will do nothing of the kind', ' My stepdaughter has been here', ' I have\\ntraced her', ' What has she been saying to you?”\\n\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes', '\\n\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously', '\\n\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\\ncompanion imperturbably', '\\n\\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop', ' “I know you, you scoundrel! I\\nhave heard of you before', ' You are Holmes, the meddler', '”\\n\\nMy friend smiled', '\\n\\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\\n\\nHis smile broadened', '\\n\\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\\n\\nHolmes chuckled heartily', ' “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\\nsaid he', ' “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\ndraught', '”\\n\\n“I will go when I have had my say', ' Don’t you dare to meddle with my\\naffairs', ' I know that Miss Stoner has been here', ' I traced her! I am a\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here', '” He stepped swiftly forward,\\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands', '\\n\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling\\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room', '\\n\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing', ' “I am not\\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own', '” As he spoke he picked up\\nthe steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again', '\\n\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her', ' And now, Watson, we\\nshall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’\\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\\nmatter', '”\\n\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\nexcursion', ' He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\\nwith notes and figures', '\\n\\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he', ' “To determine its\\nexact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\\ninvestments with which it is concerned', ' The total income, which at the\\ntime of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through\\nthe fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750', ' Each daughter can\\nclaim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage', ' It is evident,\\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\\nmere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\\nserious extent', ' My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has\\nproved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\\nof anything of the sort', ' And now, Watson, this is too serious for\\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\\ndrive to Waterloo', ' I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\nrevolver into your pocket', ' An Eley’s No', ' 2 is an excellent argument\\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots', ' That and a\\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need', '”\\n\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes', ' It was a perfect day, with a\\nbright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens', ' The trees and\\nwayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\\nair was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth', ' To me at least\\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\\nand this sinister quest upon which we were engaged', ' My companion sat in\\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\\neyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought', '\\nSuddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\\nover the meadows', '\\n\\n“Look there!” said he', '\\n\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\\na grove at the highest point', ' From amid the branches there jutted out\\nthe grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion', '\\n\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he', '\\n\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr', ' Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\\ndriver', '\\n\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we\\nare going', '”\\n\\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\\nsome distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\\nfields', ' There it is, where the lady is walking', '”\\n\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his\\neyes', ' “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest', '”\\n\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\\nLeatherhead', '\\n\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this\\nfellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\\nbusiness', ' It may stop his gossip', ' Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner', ' You see\\nthat we have been as good as our word', '”\\n\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\\nwhich spoke her joy', ' “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she\\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly', ' “All has turned out splendidly', '\\nDr', ' Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\\nbefore evening', '”\\n\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred', ' Miss\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened', '\\n\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then', '”\\n\\n“So it appears', '”\\n\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him', ' What will\\nhe say when he returns?”\\n\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\\ncunning than himself upon his track', ' You must lock yourself up from him\\nto-night', ' If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\\nHarrow', ' Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine', '”\\n\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\\nportion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\\neach side', ' In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\\nwith wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\\nruin', ' The central portion was in little better repair, but the\\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\\nthis was where the family resided', ' Some scaffolding had been erected\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit', ' Holmes\\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\\nattention the outsides of the windows', '\\n\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\ncentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to\\nDr', ' Roylott’s chamber?”\\n\\n“Exactly so', ' But I am now sleeping in the middle one', '”\\n\\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand', ' By the way, there does not\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall', '”\\n\\n“There were none', ' I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\nroom', '”\\n\\n“Ah! that is suggestive', ' Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open', ' There are windows\\nin it, of course?”\\n\\n“Yes, but very small ones', ' Too narrow for anyone to pass through', '”\\n\\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\nfrom that side', ' Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\\nand bar your shutters?”\\n\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\\nwithout success', ' There was no slit through which a knife could be\\npassed to raise the bar', ' Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry', ' “Hum!”\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly\\npresents some difficulties', ' No one could pass these shutters if they\\nwere bolted', ' Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\\nmatter', '”\\n\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\\nthree bedrooms opened', ' Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate', ' It was a\\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\\nthe fashion of old country-houses', ' A brown chest of drawers stood in\\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window', ' These articles,\\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre', ' The boards round\\nand the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\\nthe house', ' Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\nevery detail of the apartment', '\\n\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\\nlying upon the pillow', '\\n\\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room', '”\\n\\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\\n\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago', '”\\n\\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No, I never heard of her using it', ' We used always to get what we\\nwanted for ourselves', '”\\n\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there', ' You\\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\\nfloor', '” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\\nbetween the boards', ' Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\\nthe chamber was panelled', ' Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\\nsome time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall', '\\nFinally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug', '\\n\\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he', '\\n\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\n\\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire', ' This is very interesting', ' You\\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\\nopening for the ventilator is', '”\\n\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before', '”\\n\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope', ' “There are one or\\ntwo very singular points about this room', ' For example, what a fool a\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\n\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady', '\\n\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes', '\\n\\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time', '”\\n\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate', ' With your\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\\ninner apartment', '”\\n\\nDr', ' Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished', ' A camp-bed, a small wooden\\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye', '\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\\nkeenest interest', '\\n\\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe', '\\n\\n“My stepfather’s business papers', '”\\n\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\n\\n“Only once, some years ago', ' I remember that it was full of papers', '”\\n\\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\n\\n“No', ' What a strange idea!”\\n\\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\\nthe top of it', '\\n\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat', ' But there is a cheetah and a baboon', '”\\n\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay', '\\nThere is one point which I should wish to determine', '” He squatted down\\nin front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\\ngreatest attention', '\\n\\n“Thank you', ' That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\\nlens in his pocket', ' “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\\n\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\\ncorner of the bed', ' The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\\nso as to make a loop of whipcord', '\\n\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\\n\\n“It’s a common enough lash', ' But I don’t know why it should be tied', '”\\n\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and\\nwhen a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all', ' I\\nthink that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn', '”\\n\\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation', ' We had walked\\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\\nreverie', '\\n\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect', '”\\n\\n“I shall most certainly do so', '”\\n\\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation', ' Your life may depend\\nupon your compliance', '”\\n\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands', '”\\n\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\nroom', '”\\n\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment', '\\n\\n“Yes, it must be so', ' Let me explain', ' I believe that that is the village\\ninn over there?”\\n\\n“Yes, that is the Crown', '”\\n\\n“Very good', ' Your windows would be visible from there?”\\n\\n“Certainly', '”\\n\\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\\nwhen your stepfather comes back', ' Then when you hear him retire for the\\nnight, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\\nyour lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\\noccupy', ' I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\\nthere for one night', '”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, easily', '”\\n\\n“The rest you will leave in our hands', '”\\n\\n“But what will you do?”\\n\\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you', '”\\n\\n“I believe, Mr', ' Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve', '\\n\\n“Perhaps I have', '”\\n\\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s\\ndeath', '”\\n\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak', '”\\n\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\ndied from some sudden fright', '”\\n\\n“No, I do not think so', ' I think that there was probably some more\\ntangible cause', ' And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr', '\\nRoylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain', ' Good-bye, and\\nbe brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured\\nthat we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you', '”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn', ' They were on the upper floor, and from\\nour window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House', ' At dusk we saw Dr', ' Grimesby\\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\\nof the lad who drove him', ' The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s\\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him', '\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms', '\\n\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\\ndarkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night', ' There\\nis a distinct element of danger', '”\\n\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\n\\n“Your presence might be invaluable', '”\\n\\n“Then I shall certainly come', '”\\n\\n“It is very kind of you', '”\\n\\n“You speak of danger', ' You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\nwas visible to me', '”\\n\\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more', ' I imagine that\\nyou saw all that I did', '”\\n\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine', '”\\n\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\\nsmall opening between two rooms', ' It was so small that a rat could\\nhardly pass through', '”\\n\\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\nMoran', '”\\n\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I did', ' You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\ncould smell Dr', ' Roylott’s cigar', ' Now, of course that suggested at once\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms', ' It could only\\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s\\ninquiry', ' I deduced a ventilator', '”\\n\\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\\n\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates', ' A ventilator\\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies', ' Does\\nnot that strike you?”\\n\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection', '”\\n\\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\\n\\n“No', '”\\n\\n“It was clamped to the floor', ' Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\nbefore?”\\n\\n“I cannot say that I have', '”\\n\\n“The lady could not move her bed', ' It must always be in the same\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call\\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull', '”\\n\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at', ' We are\\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime', '”\\n\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough', ' When a doctor does go wrong he is\\nthe first of criminals', ' He has nerve and he has knowledge', ' Palmer and\\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession', ' This man strikes\\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\\ndeeper still', ' But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\\nover; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful', '”\\n\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House', ' Two hours passed slowly\\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\\nlight shone out right in front of us', '\\n\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes\\nfrom the middle window', '”\\n\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\npossible that we might spend the night there', ' A moment later we were\\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\\nsombre errand', '\\n\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall', ' Making our way among the trees, we\\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\\nwith writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\ndarkness', '\\n\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\n\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I', ' His hand closed like a vice\\nupon my wrist in his agitation', ' Then he broke into a low laugh and put\\nhis lips to my ear', '\\n\\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured', ' “That is the baboon', '”\\n\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected', ' There was a\\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\\nmoment', ' I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\nHolmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\\nbedroom', ' My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room', ' All was as we had\\nseen it in the daytime', ' Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\\nI could do to distinguish the words:\\n\\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans', '”\\n\\nI nodded to show that I had heard', '\\n\\n“We must sit without light', ' He would see it through the ventilator', '”\\n\\nI nodded again', '\\n\\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it', ' Have your pistol\\nready in case we should need it', ' I will sit on the side of the bed, and\\nyou in that chair', '”\\n\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table', '\\n\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\\nbeside him', ' By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle', '\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness', '\\n\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\ntension in which I was myself', ' The shutters cut off the least ray of\\nlight, and we waited in absolute darkness', '\\n\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\\nvery window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\\nwas indeed at liberty', ' Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\\nparish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour', ' How long they\\nseemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\\nstill we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall', '\\n\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal', ' Someone in the next room\\nhad lit a dark-lantern', ' I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger', ' For half an\\nhour I sat with straining ears', ' Then suddenly another sound became\\naudible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle', ' The instant that we heard it,\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\nhis cane at the bell-pull', '\\n\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled', ' “You see it?”\\n\\nBut I saw nothing', ' At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\\nlow, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\\nso savagely', ' I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\\nfilled with horror and loathing', ' He had ceased to strike and was gazing\\nup at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\\nnight the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened', ' It swelled\\nup louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\\nmingled in the one dreadful shriek', ' They say that away down in the\\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\\nsleepers from their beds', ' It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\\ngazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\\naway into the silence from which it rose', '\\n\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped', '\\n\\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered', ' “And perhaps, after\\nall, it is for the best', ' Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr', '\\nRoylott’s room', '”\\n\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor', '\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within', ' Then\\nhe turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\npistol in my hand', '\\n\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes', ' On the table stood a\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\\nlight upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar', ' Beside this\\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr', ' Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\\ngrey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers', ' Across his lap lay the short\\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day', ' His chin\\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\\nthe corner of the ceiling', ' Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\\nhis head', ' As we entered he made neither sound nor motion', '\\n\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes', '\\n\\nI took a step forward', ' In an instant his strange headgear began to\\nmove, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent', '\\n\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India', ' He\\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten', ' Violence does, in truth,\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\\ndigs for another', ' Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\\ncan then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\\npolice know what has happened', '”\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\\nperch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\nwhich he closed upon it', '\\n\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr', ' Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\nMoran', ' It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet', ' The little which I had yet\\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\\nback next day', '\\n\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\ninsufficient data', ' The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\\n‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent', ' I\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\\noccupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door', '\\nMy attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\\nthis ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed', ' The\\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\\nfloor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\\na bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed', '\\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\\nwith my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\\ncreatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track', '\\nThe idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training', ' The rapidity\\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\\nof view, be an advantage', ' It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\nthe poison fangs had done their work', ' Then I thought of the whistle', ' Of\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\\nthe victim', ' He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\\nsaw, to return to him when summoned', ' He would put it through this\\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed', ' It might or might not\\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim', '\\n\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room', ' An\\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\\nshould reach the ventilator', ' The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\\nand the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\\nmay have remained', ' The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\\nobviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\\nupon its terrible occupant', ' Having once made up my mind, you know the\\nsteps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof', ' I heard the\\ncreature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\\nthe light and attacked it', '”\\n\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator', '”\\n\\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\nother side', ' Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its\\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw', ' In this\\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr', ' Grimesby Roylott’s\\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\\nconscience', '”\\n\\n\\n\\nIX', ' THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB\\n\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr', '\\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there\\nwere only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that\\nof Mr', ' Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness', ' Of\\nthese the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and\\noriginal observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so\\ndramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed\\nupon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable\\nresults', ' The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the\\nnewspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\\nstriking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than\\nwhen the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery\\nclears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which\\nleads on to the complete truth', ' At the time the circumstances made a\\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served\\nto weaken the effect', '\\n\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise', ' I had returned to\\ncivil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\\nrooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even\\npersuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\\nus', ' My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no\\nvery great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from\\namong the officials', ' One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and\\nlingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of\\nendeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\\ninfluence', '\\n\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the\\nmaid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from\\nPaddington and were waiting in the consulting-room', ' I dressed\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\\ntrivial, and hastened downstairs', ' As I descended, my old ally, the\\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him', '\\n\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\\n“he’s all right', '”\\n\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room', '\\n\\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered', ' “I thought I’d bring him round\\nmyself; then he couldn’t slip away', ' There he is, all safe and sound', ' I\\nmust go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you', '” And off\\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him', '\\n\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table', '\\nHe was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap\\nwhich he had laid down upon my books', ' Round one of his hands he had a\\nhandkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains', ' He\\nwas young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,\\nmasculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression\\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took\\nall his strength of mind to control', '\\n\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had\\na very serious accident during the night', ' I came in by train this\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here', ' I gave the maid a\\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table', '”\\n\\nI took it up and glanced at it', ' “Mr', ' Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)', '” That was the name, style,\\nand abode of my morning

'”\\n\\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed', ' He\\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\\nchair and shaking his sides', ' All my medical instincts rose up against\\nthat laugh', '\\n\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some\\nwater from a caraffe', '\\n\\nIt was useless, however', ' He was off in one of those hysterical\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\\nover and gone', ' Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\\npale-looking', '\\n\\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped', '\\n\\n“Not at all', ' Drink this', '” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\\ncolour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks', '\\n\\n“That’s better!” said he', ' “And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly\\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be', '”\\n\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand', ' It gave even my\\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it', ' There were four protruding\\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\\nbeen', ' It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots', '\\n\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury', ' It must have bled\\nconsiderably', '”\\n\\n“Yes, it did', ' I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\nbeen senseless for a long time', ' When I came to I found that it was\\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round\\nthe wrist and braced it up with a twig', '”\\n\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon', '”\\n\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\nprovince', '”\\n\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and\\nsharp instrument', '”\\n\\n“A thing like a cleaver,” said he', '\\n\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\n\\n“By no means', '”\\n\\n“What! a murderous attack?”\\n\\n“Very murderous indeed', '”\\n\\n“You horrify me', '”\\n\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\\nover with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages', ' He lay back without\\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time', '\\n\\n“How is that?” I asked when I had finished', '\\n\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man', ' I was\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through', '”\\n\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter', ' It is evidently trying\\nto your nerves', '”\\n\\n“Oh, no, not now', ' I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for\\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which\\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\\nbe done', '”\\n\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\nfriend, Mr', ' Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police', '”\\n\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should\\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\nuse the official police as well', ' Would you give me an introduction to\\nhim?”\\n\\n“I’ll do better', ' I’ll take you round to him myself', '”\\n\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you', '”\\n\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together', ' We shall just be in time to have a\\nlittle breakfast with him', ' Do you feel equal to it?”\\n\\n“Yes;

fields', ' On examining it,\\nhowever, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and\\nthat it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\\nand left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours', ' These\\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that\\nwhich was quite as valuable as a gold-mine', ' Naturally, it was to my\\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but\\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this', ' I took a few\\nof my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we\\nshould quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in\\nthis way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the\\nneighbouring fields', ' This we have now been doing for some time, and in\\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press', ' This\\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish\\nyour advice upon

when I glanced in his direction,\\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity', ' The country roads seem\\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\\njolted terribly', ' I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light', ' Now

road was exchanged for\\nthe crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\\nstand', ' Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\\npulled me swiftly into a

The\\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\\nbehind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\\ndrove away', '\\n\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath', ' Suddenly a door\\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\\nshot out in our direction', ' It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\\nlamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\\nforward and peering at us', ' I could see that she was pretty, and from\\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\\nwas a rich material', ' She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\\nher hand', ' Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand', '\\n\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\nminutes,’ said he, throwing open another door', ' It was a quiet, little,\\nplainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\nseveral German books were scattered', ' Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\\non the top of a harmonium beside the door', ' ‘I shall not keep you\\nwaiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness', '\\n\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\\nothers being volumes of poetry', ' Then I walked across to the window,\\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it', ' It was a wonderfully\\nsilent house', ' There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\\npassage,

to starting for Eyford', '”\\n\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village', ' There were Sherlock\\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\\na plain-clothes man, and myself', ' Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\\nof the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\\na circle with Eyford for its centre', '\\n\\n“There you are,” said he', ' “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten\\nmiles from the village', ' The place we want must be somewhere

'”\\n\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet', ' “Well, I have\\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\\nthat we are in search of are to be found', '”\\n\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly', '\\n\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you', ' I say it is south, for the\\ncountry is more deserted there', '”\\n\\n“And I say east,” said my patient', '\\n\\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man', ' “There are several\\nquiet little

'”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, you can', ' This is my point', '” He placed his finger in the\\ncentre of the circle', ' “This is where we shall find them', '”\\n\\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley', '\\n\\n“Six out and six back', ' Nothing simpler', ' You say yourself that the horse\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in', ' How could it be that if it had\\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\\n\\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully', '\\n“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang', '”\\n\\n“None at all,” said Holmes', ' “They are coiners on a large scale, and\\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\\nsilver', '”\\n\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\\ninspector', ' “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand', ' We\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\\nhands', ' But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\\nthem right enough', '”\\n\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\\nto fall into the hands of justice', ' As we rolled into Eyford Station we\\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\\nclump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\\nfeather over the landscape', '\\n\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\\nits way', '\\n\\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master', '\\n\\n“When did it break out?”\\n\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\\nthe whole place is in a blaze', '”\\n\\n“Whose house is it?”\\n\\n“Dr', ' Becher’s', '”\\n\\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr', ' Becher a German, very thin,\\nwith a long, sharp nose?”\\n\\nThe station-master laughed heartily', ' “No, sir, Dr', ' Becher is an\\nEnglishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\nwaistcoat', ' But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\\nunderstand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm', '”\\n\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\nhastening in the direction of the fire', ' The road topped a low hill, and\\nthere was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under', '\\n\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement', ' “There is the\\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay', ' That second\\nwindow is the one that I jumped from', '”\\n\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them', '\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time', '\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now', '”\\n\\nAnd Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\\nGerman, or the morose Englishman', ' Early that morning a peasant had met\\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to\\ndiscover the least clue as to their whereabouts', '\\n\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor', ' About sunset,\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly', ' Large masses of nickel and of tin\\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\nbeen already referred to', '\\n\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\\ntale', ' He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones', ' On the\\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger', '\\n\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\\nmore to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\n\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing', ' “Indirectly it may be of value,\\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence', '”\\n\\n\\n\\nX', ' THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\n\\nThe Lord St', ' Simon marriage, and

last few years, and as Lord St', ' Simon has\\nno property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is\\nobvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress', '’”\\n\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning', '\\n\\n“Oh, yes; plenty', ' Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\nbe at St', ' George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr', ' Aloysius\\nDoran', ' Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield', ' Those are\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride', '”\\n\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start', '\\n\\n“The vanishing of the lady', '”\\n\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\n\\n“At the wedding breakfast', '”\\n\\n“Indeed', ' This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\ndramatic, in fact', '”\\n\\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common', '”\\n\\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this', '\\nPray let me have the details', '”\\n\\n“I warn you that they are very incomplete', '”\\n\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so', '”\\n\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you', ' It is headed, ‘Singular\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\\n\\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St', ' Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\\nplace in connection with his wedding', ' The ceremony, as shortly\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\nrumours which have been so persistently floating about', ' In spite of the\\nattempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention\\nhas now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by\\naffecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation', '\\n\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St', ' George’s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\nbride, Mr', ' Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\nLord Eustace and Lady Clara St', ' Simon (the younger brother and sister\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington', ' The whole party\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr', ' Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared', ' It appears that some little\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who\\nendeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St', ' Simon', ' It was only after\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\nthe footman', ' The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room', '\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the\\npassage', ' One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the\\nhouse thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company', ' On ascertaining that\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr', ' Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the\\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business', '\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the\\nwhereabouts of the missing lady', ' There are rumours of foul play in the\\nmatter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the\\nwoman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\nstrange disappearance of the bride', '’”\\n\\n“And is that all?”\\n\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\nsuggestive one', '”\\n\\n“And it is—”\\n\\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested', ' It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\nat the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years', '\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\nnow—so far as it has been set forth in the public press', '”\\n\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be', ' I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds', ' But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\nwill prove to be our noble client', ' Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own\\nmemory', '”\\n\\n“Lord Robert St', ' Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\ndoor', ' A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with\\nthe steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever\\nbeen to command and to be obeyed', ' His manner was brisk, and yet his\\ngeneral appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight\\nforward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked', ' His hair,\\ntoo, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\\nedges and thin upon the top', ' As to his dress, it was careful to the\\nverge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured\\ngaiters', ' He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\neyeglasses', '\\n\\n“Good-day, Lord St', ' Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing', ' “Pray take\\nthe basket-chair', ' This is my friend and colleague, Dr', ' Watson', ' Draw up\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over', '”\\n\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr', '\\nHolmes', ' I have been cut to the quick', ' I understand that you have\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society', '”\\n\\n“No, I am descending', '”\\n\\n“I beg pardon', '”\\n\\n“My last client of the sort was a king', '”\\n\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea', ' And which king?”\\n\\n“The King of Scandinavia', '”\\n\\n“What!

Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon', ' As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion', '”\\n\\n“Thank you', ' I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\nnothing more', ' I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for\\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride', '”\\n\\nLord St', ' Simon glanced over it', ' “Yes, it is correct, as far as it\\ngoes', '”\\n\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer\\nan opinion', ' I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\nquestioning you', '”\\n\\n“Pray do so', '”\\n\\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\n\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago', '”\\n\\n“You were travelling in the States?”\\n\\n“Yes', '”\\n\\n“Did you become engaged then?”\\n\\n“No', '”\\n\\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\\n\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused', '”\\n\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\n\\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope', '”\\n\\n“And how did he make his money?”\\n\\n“In mining', ' He had nothing a few years ago', ' Then he struck gold,\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds', '”\\n\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s\\ncharacter?”\\n\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\nfire', ' “You see, Mr', ' Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her\\nfather became a rich man', ' During that time she ran free in a mining\\ncamp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has\\ncome from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster', ' She is what we call\\nin England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\\nany sort of traditions', ' She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say', '\\nShe is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\\nresolutions', ' On the other hand, I would not have given her the name\\nwhich I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I\\nnot thought her to be at bottom a noble woman', ' I believe that she is\\ncapable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would\\nbe repugnant to her', '”\\n\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\n\\n“I brought this with me', '” He opened a locket and showed us the full\\nface of a very lovely woman', ' It was not a photograph but an ivory\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth', '\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it', ' Then he closed the locket and\\nhanded it back to Lord St', ' Simon', '\\n\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?”\\n\\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season', ' I met\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her', '”\\n\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\n\\n“A fair dowry', ' Not more than is usual in my family', '”\\n\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\naccompli_?”\\n\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject', '”\\n\\n“Very naturally not', ' Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\nwedding?”\\n\\n“Yes', '”\\n\\n“Was she in good spirits?”\\n\\n“Never better', ' She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\nlives', '”\\n\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting', ' And on the morning of the wedding?”\\n\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony', '”\\n\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\n\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp', ' The incident however, was\\ntoo trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case', '”\\n\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that', '”\\n\\n“Oh, it is childish', ' She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\nvestry', ' She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\ninto the pew', ' There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\\nthe fall', ' Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\nagitated over this trifling cause', '”\\n\\n“Indeed!

The dear fellow wanted\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle', ' How\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!”\\n\\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\nwhich might help me', ' I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\nimpressions', ' I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable', ' Just beyond it, however, at the\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg', ' I\\ncould even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away', ' I\\nthought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so', ' I\\npassed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\nme', '\\n\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet', ' I was\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\nson', ' The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\\nas his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\\nwas obvious that he had passed after the other', ' I followed them up and\\nfound they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\\naway while waiting', ' Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\\nyards or more down the lane', ' I saw where Boots had faced round, where\\nthe snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\\nwhere a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\\nmistaken', ' Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\\nof blood showed that it was he who had been hurt', ' When he came to the\\nhighroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\\nso there was an end to that clue', '\\n\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\\nthat someone had passed out', ' I could distinguish the outline of an\\ninstep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in', ' I was then\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred', ' A man\\nhad waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\\nhad been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\\nwith him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected', ' He had\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\nopponent', ' So far I was clear', ' The question now was, who was the man and\\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\\n\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth', ' Now, I knew\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\nyour niece and the maids', ' But if it were the maids, why should your son\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\nreason', ' As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\nexplanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret\\nwas a disgraceful one', ' When I remembered that you had seen her at that\\nwindow, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\nconjecture became a certainty', '\\n\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\nwas a very limited one', ' But among them was Sir George Burnwell', ' I had\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women', ' It\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems', '\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\nwithout compromising his own family', '\\n\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next', ' I\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up\\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes', ' With these I\\njourneyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the\\ntracks', '”\\n\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr', '\\nHolder', '\\n\\n“Precisely', ' It was I', ' I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes', ' It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\nmatter', ' I went and saw him', ' At first, of course, he denied everything', '\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\nbluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall', ' I knew my man,\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike', '\\nThen he became a little more reasonable', ' I told him that we would give\\nhim a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece', ' That brought out the\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown', ' ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,\\n‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\nwould be no prosecution', ' Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\ngot our stones at £ 1000 apiece', ' Then I looked in upon your son, told\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,\\nafter what I may call a really hard day’s work', '”\\n\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the\\nbanker, rising', ' “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done', ' Your skill has indeed\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it', ' And now I must fly to my dear boy\\nto apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him', ' As to what you\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart', ' Not even your skill can\\ninform me where she is now', '”\\n\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is', ' It is equally certain, too, that\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\npunishment', '”\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by \\nArthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n"
